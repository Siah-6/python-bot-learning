# Python Learning

This repository documents my journey of learning Python from scratch.  
The end goal is to create a macro bot that adapts to randomized game angles using automation and image recognition.

## üî• Goals
- Learn Python basics: variables, loops, conditions, functions
- Use PyAutoGUI for automation (mouse & keyboard)
- Explore OpenCV for detecting screen elements
- Build a bot that interacts via emulator

## üìÖ Learning Stages

| Stage | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | Python Basics |
| 2     | Automation (PyAutoGUI, input control) |
| 3     | Image Detection (screenshots, OpenCV) |
| 4     | Smart Logic + Emulator Interaction |

## üìÅ Progresss
This repo will be updated with:
- Code samples as I learn
- Notes and tips
- Eventually: working bot scripts
